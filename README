A clock that displays time with words.

We turn all the words required to display the (approximate) current time.
Time will be accurate to within five minutes.  First thought was to use the
five minute time closest to the current time, so we're never more than 2.5
minutes out.  Another suggestion was to switch to the correct time at every
five minute boundary, then maintain that to the next five minute boundary.
Second idea is probably easier to program, and would require less
explaining to people.


Some suggested layouts:

Half Quarter
Twenty Five Ten
Past To One Two
Three Four Five
Six Seven Eight
Nine Ten Eleven
Twelve O'Clock

Ten Quarter Twenty Five
Half Past To One Two
Three Four Five Six
Seven Eight Nine Ten
Eleven Twelve O'Clock
